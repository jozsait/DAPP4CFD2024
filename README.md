# DAPP4CFD2024
MATLAB codes to assist learning during the CFD Data Analysis module


## Signals
BOS1 - first breakout session on data representation

BOS2 - second breakout session on polynomial reconstruction

BOS3 - third breakout session on github repo creation

BOS4 - fourth breakout session on statistics and CTA data analysis


## Fourier_transform
BOS_FT_simple_signal.m - code showing nuerical and symbolic Fourier transformation computations

SiSiFT.m - Single sided discrete Fourier transform function for 1D signals


## Uncertainty_session
BOS1 - Lift coefficient and uncertainty calculations

BOS2 - Comprehensive grid convergence analysis

precision_demo.m - snippet on precision and overflow/underflow


## MMS_example
Solution of the unsteady 1D heat conduction equation with manufactured solution implemented for verification purposes. By default, the code generates a 1000 pictures which can be turned into a video using the video_maker.m file.
